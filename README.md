# Kneeboard Notes

Provides a way to create notes for A5 aviation kneeboards. The format of the generated notes is primarily relevent to PPL(A) in the UK.

The notes are generated as a PDF document for printing, and can be saved as [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is also supported to a lesser extent.

The repository is available here: [Kneeboard Notes](https://github.com/kneeboard/kneeboard)
